Description
-----------

After Protector Myssil died (some say by the daggers of a shadowy backstabber,
while others bespoke of a crazed mage drawing fiendish black magicks),
the fanatic Ziguranth order crumbled into chaos, and its numbers dwindled
into insignificance.


Gameplay
--------

Reduces the maximum number of Ziguranth patrols from five (5) to one (1) after Myssil dies.
