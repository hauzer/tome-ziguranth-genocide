This is an addon for the tactical roguelike RPG, `Tales of Maj'Eyal <http://te4.org/>`_.

Description
-----------

After Protector Myssil died, some say by the daggers of a shadowy backstabber,
while others bespoke of a crazed mage drawing fiendish black magicks,
the fanatic Ziguranth order crumbled into chaos and their numbers dwindled
into insignificance.


Gameplay
--------

Reduces the maximum number of Ziguranth patrols from five (5) to one (1) after Myssil dies.
